[Neat](https://github.com/ververcpp/Neat) is a clean theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com 'Jekyll').
It was written  in plain HTML, SCSS & Javascript. The agile nav-bar is powered by 
[Headroom.js](https://www.github.com/WickyNilliams/headroom.js, 'Headroom.js').

The theme is mobile optimised and looks great in Chrome, safari and Firefox.
