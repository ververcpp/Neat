##Get start

* [Fork this repository](https://github.com/ververcpp/Neat/fork)
* Clone it: ```git clone https://github.com/username/Neat```
* ```bundle install```
* Run the server and watch assets change using ```rake```, go to http://localhost:4000 for your site.

##Customization
* You can change ```_config.yml``` file to customize your information. 
* Change about.md for blog intro.
* For domain settings, see [the guide from Github](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/)

##One more thing
The ```gh-pages``` branch is the project page, which **should not** be used as your blog,
so use ```master``` branch for your blog. If your blog site uses own domain, please delete 
the ```gh-pages``` respository and create a branch off the ```master``` branch.
